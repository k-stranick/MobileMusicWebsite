                <p class="lead my-3 p-index">"Returnal" is a sci-fi third-person shooter and roguelike developed by
                    Housemarque and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. Released in April 2021 for PlayStation
                    5, the game is celebrated for its challenging gameplay, haunting atmosphere, and deeply layered
                    narrative. It tells the story of Selene Vassos, an Astra scout trapped on the mysterious alien
                    planet of Atropos, caught in a time loop where death resets her journey.
                    <span class="more-text">
                        <br><br>
                        The game follows Selene as she investigates a distress signal—codenamed “White Shadow”—emanating
                        from Atropos. Her ship, the Helios, crashes on the planet, and she discovers it’s hostile,
                        dangerous, and shrouded in mystery. Strangely, every time she dies, the loop resets, with
                        Atropos reconfiguring its layout. Along the way, Selene uncovers cryptic logs of her own past
                        lives and memories that question her sanity.
                        <br>
                        As the story unfolds, themes of trauma, loss, and guilt become central to the narrative. The
                        deeper Selene delves into the planet, the more the lines blur between her memories and Atropos’s
                        alien horrors. Players are left piecing together the psychological story through scattered
                        fragments.
                        <br><br>
                        Returnal is a hybrid of bullet-hell action and roguelike mechanics, offering fast-paced and
                        fluid combat with an emphasis on skill. The game’s design encourages players to adapt to the
                        game’s ever-changing environments, with each run presenting new challenges and opportunities.
                        <br><br>
                        Returnal stands out by exploring the psychological aspects of its protagonist, intertwining
                        gameplay with its themes. The game’s atmosphere, combined with its haunting soundtrack, immerses
                        players in a world that is as beautiful as it is terrifying. The game’s narrative is rich with
                        symbolism and themes, including:
                        <br><br>
                        Time and Mortality:
                        <br>
                        The time loop symbolizes Selene’s inability to escape her past and the cyclical nature of her
                        guilt and trauma.
                        <br><br>
                        Psychological Exploration:
                        <br>
                        The story blurs the line between reality and memory, with Atropos serving as a metaphorical
                        representation of Selene’s subconscious.
                        Survival and Perseverance:
                        <br><br>
                        The game emphasizes resilience in the face of constant failure and the drive to uncover the
                        truth, no matter the cost.
